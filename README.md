#ABOUT THE SCRIPT.

With this library, reducing image sizes and controlling quality is effortless, and you don't need any desktop applications to do it. It's a web-based solution that works perfectly with XAMPP or online hosting. You can process multiple files simultaneously with batch processing, and we plan to keep making it better. We welcome contributions from anyone interested in shaping its future. Expect refinements, enhanced user interfaces, and additional features to come.
